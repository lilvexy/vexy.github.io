# Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my IT Security blog! Here I document everything I learn as a student specializing in IT Security analysis. 

On this blog, I share:

- Documentations of my labs in networking and account management.
- Own scripts (Python, Bash, Powershell, javascript& HTML and css)
- Network traffic analysis (e.g., Wireshark)
- Risk Management/ Security standards and Regulatory compliance. 
- Incident response exercises and SOC-related projects  
- Reflections from courses, assignments, and personal projects  

The goal is to document my journey in IT security, collect my learning experiences, and create a portfolio to showcase my skills to potential employers or internship opportunities (internship Period 2026-12-2027-5)
